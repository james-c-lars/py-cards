# py-cards
A module which creates a bunch of objects and data structures for simulating games with playing cards

Of particular note are the PlayingCard object which can be initialized with any of the four standard suits (Spades, hearts, clubs, or diamonds) and any of the 14 major faces (Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Joker); the Deck object which can be initialized with the standard 52 cards, shuffled, dealt from, and easily merged with any other data structure; and the Hand object which can hold cards but can also store other pertinent data about a possible player such as a name in the form of a properties dictionary.

This module has been used in the included solitaire and blackjack game
